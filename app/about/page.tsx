        Hi there! My grandpa always believed I’d do something in science because
        I was a curious kid. I was the one opening up toys to see who was
        “speaking” inside, connecting rotors and batteries, trying to build a
        motor car or helicopter. I always wondered: how does a remote control
        talk to a toy car or a TV? What’s the connection between them? As I grew
        up, my curiosity shifted towards people. I loved talking to others,
        understanding their challenges, and finding ways to help. It gave me a
        sense of purpose, like “everything has a solution; you’re just a bit of
        knowledge away from finding it.” This drew me into studying Law,
        focusing my curiosity on understanding human interactions instead of
        gadgets. University introduced me to people from all walks of life, and
        I happened to have roommates studying computer science. While I was deep
        into Law, I found myself engrossed in the world of the Internet of
        Things (IoT). I was fascinated—how do you instruct robots to work in a
        field? Where do these devices get their orders? How do they communicate
        with each other and with humans? The idea of cloud computing blew my
        mind. Was it the same “cloud” I’d heard of, or something entirely
        different? This curiosity sparked my passion for user interfaces and
        technology. After graduating and completing law school, I knew I wanted
        to dedicate my life to tech. Starting over didn’t scare me—I finally
        felt like I could create and understand what had once been a mystery. I
        taught myself Python and JavaScript and joined the ALX Software
        Engineering 12-month program, where I deepened my skills in data
        structures, algorithms, full-stack development, reverse engineering,
        scripting, C programming, and computer science fundamentals. I have big
        dreams! I want to bring technology to education, agriculture, and the
        military. I believe I’m on the right path, and I have a lot to learn and
        get my hands on! You can be the channel for me, and I’d love for you to
        join me on this journey. Let’s connect—drop me a message, and I’ll get
        back to you as soon as I can!
