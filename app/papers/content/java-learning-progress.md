Every journey has its ups and downs, and learning Java is no different. Over the past few months, I've been slowly but steadily improving my understanding of Java's core concepts and working on side projects to practice.

## Key Concepts Iâ€™ve Mastered So Far

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Understanding classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Collections Framework: Mastering data structures like ArrayLists, HashMaps, and LinkedLists.
- Streams and Lambdas: Learning the functional side of Java through streams and lambda expressions.
