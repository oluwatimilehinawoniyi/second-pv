Nigeria is a country rich with opportunities, but for tech enthusiasts, the journey can be a mix of highs and lows. Despite infrastructural challenges, Nigerian developers are resilient, creating solutions that make global impact.

#### Power Outages

One of the most persistent challenges in Nigeria is inconsistent power supply. For a software developer, this can mean struggling to meet deadlines or sudden interruptions during critical work.

#### High Cost of Internet

Affordable, reliable internet access is still a luxury for many. Techies often invest heavily in mobile data or specialized ISPs to maintain productivity.

#### Bright Spots

Despite these challenges, the Nigerian tech community is thriving. Co-working spaces, tech hubs, and vibrant developer communities like Andela and Flutterwave are providing platforms for growth.
